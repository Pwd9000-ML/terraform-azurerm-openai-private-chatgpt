          scale_size     = (Optional) The SKU size. When the name field is the combination of tier and some other value, this would be the standalone code. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
          scale_family   = (Optional) If the service has different generations of hardware, for the same SKU, then that can be captured here. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
          scale_capacity = (Optional) Tokens-per-Minute (TPM). If the SKU supports scale out/in then the capacity integer should be included. If scale out/in is not possible for the resource this may be omitted. Default value is 1. Changing this forces a new resource to be created.
